## 📦 Installation
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theo79/3DPrint-Cost-Estimator.git
   cd 3DPrint-Cost-Estimator
3. Run the script
   ```bash
   python cost_estimator.py

⚙️ How It Works

Enter values for filament weight, filament price per kg, print time, and electricity cost.
The script calculates:

* Filament Cost: Based on weight used

* Electricity Cost: Based on print duration

* Labor Cost: Default €5.0/hour (adjustable)

* Machine Wear Cost: Default €1.5/hour (adjustable)

* Total Price: Adds a 25% profit margin (modifiable)

* Displays the final estimated price in a GUI window.
